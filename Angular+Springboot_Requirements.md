## üìÑ **Chunk 8 ‚Äì Data Relationships, Real-time Updates, and Security Protocols**

---

### **Purpose**

This chunk defines how updates are handled in real-time, and how security measures are enforced. These foundations ensure that the system works seamlessly, efficiently, and safely across all user interactions.

---

### **1. Real-time Updates**

The system ensures data stays fresh and responsive without manual refreshes.

---

#### **Real-time Constraints**

* **Events Display**

  * Automatically filters upcoming events based on current date.
  * Past events are removed from user views.

* **Registration**

  * Updates appear in real time after submission.

* **Comments and Feedback**

  * New comments or feedback appear instantly without page reloads.

* **Dashboard Metrics**

  * Admin‚Äôs dashboard reflects updates as soon as changes are made.

---

#### **Implementation Techniques**

* Use WebSockets or polling strategies to push real-time updates.
* Integrate Angular services with Spring Boot‚Äôs REST endpoints for efficient state management.
* Use event-driven architecture patterns to decouple UI updates from backend operations.

---

### **2. Security Protocols**

Data protection is critical, especially when dealing with user information and financial transactions.

---

#### **Authentication & Authorization**

* All routes should be guarded based on user roles.
* JWT tokens should be used for session management.
* Email verification ensures user authenticity.
* Admin-only routes are restricted by backend validation.

---

#### **Data Integrity**

* Input validation on both frontend and backend.
* File uploads must be checked for size and format.
* Duplicate result entries are prevented at the database level.
* Date constraints are enforced before event creation.

---

#### **Payment Security**

* As Payment Integration is ignored, Ignore this too....
* Cashfree MCP integration must follow recommended encryption protocols.
* Payment callbacks should be verified before updating records.
* Sensitive information must not be exposed via APIs.

---

#### **Privacy & Data Handling**

* Passwords are stored using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
* All API calls must use HTTPS.
* Personal data such as email and phone numbers are masked or protected when not required.

---

### **3. Additional Guidelines**

* Every CRUD operation should be logged for audit purposes.
* Admins should be warned before deleting critical data.
* Sessions should expire after inactivity.
* Rate limiting should be applied to sensitive endpoints like login and email verification.

## üìÑ **Chunk 9 ‚Äì Testing Scenarios, Error Handling, and Deployment Notes**

---

### **Purpose**

This chunk defines how the system should be tested to ensure reliability, responsiveness, and security. It also outlines strategies for managing errors gracefully and provides deployment guidelines that safeguard data and ensure smooth operation.

---

### **1. Testing Scenarios**

A robust testing framework ensures that the platform functions as expected under various conditions.

---

#### **Unit Testing**

* **Authentication**

  * Test email format validation for both students and admins.
  * Verify signup process includes email verification.
  * Ensure login prompts for correct credentials only.

* **Event Creation**

  * Validate date constraints for start and end dates.
  * Check that past dates cannot be submitted.
  * Verify event data is correctly saved.

* **Commenting**

  * Confirm comments are linked to users.
  * Test that only logged-in users can post comments.

* **Results Upload**

  * Validate CSV file format and datatype constraints.
  * Ensure duplicate entries are blocked.
  * Verify results appear in the user‚Äôs view after upload.

* **Each Module is able to perform the crud operation**

---

#### **Integration Testing**

* Check interaction between frontend and backend endpoints.
* Verify that event details display correctly on the calendar.
* Ensure comments and feedback appear in real-time.
* Test API endpoints with valid and invalid tokens.

---

#### **UI/UX Testing**

* Validate responsiveness across devices.
* Ensure hover effects, animations, and transitions work smoothly.
* Test that floating elements like the chatbot, navbar, and calendar are accessible.

---

#### **Security Testing**

* Attempt unauthorized access to admin routes.
* Test for SQL injection and ensure queries are sanitized.
* Validate encryption and secure communication for sensitive endpoints.

---

#### **Performance Testing**

* Simulate multiple users registering and commenting simultaneously.
* Test how the system handles real-time updates without slowing down.

---

### **2. Error Handling**

Handling errors gracefully improves user experience and prevents data corruption.

---

#### **Common Error Types**

1. **Validation Errors**

   * Wrong email format.
   * Missing required fields.
   * Date constraints violated.

2. **Authentication Errors**

   * Incorrect password.
   * Expired verification code.
   * Unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Data Integrity Errors**

   * Duplicate result entries.
   * Invalid file uploads.
   * API request failures.

4. **Network Errors**

   * Timeout or lost connection.
   * Payment gateway failures.

---

#### **Error Display Guidelines**

* Use clear, non-technical messages for users.
* Display error prompts near the form fields.
* Provide actionable suggestions, like ‚ÄúPlease enter a valid date.‚Äù
* Implement fallback options, like retry buttons for failed requests.

---

### **3. Deployment Notes**

Deploying the application requires careful planning to ensure scalability and security.

---

#### **Environment Setup**

* Separate environments for development, testing, and production.
* Use environment variables to manage sensitive information like API keys.
* Configure HTTPS for secure data exchange.

---

#### **Database Configuration**

* Enable automatic backups for the PostgreSQL database.
* Implement version control for database schemas.
* Monitor performance using database logs.

---

#### **CI/CD Pipeline**

* Automate builds using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
* Validate code quality with linting and static analysis.
* Run tests before merging code into the main branch.

---

### **4. Final Notes**

* Perform periodic audits of the system‚Äôs security.
* Keep dependencies updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review logs to preempt issues before they escalate.
* Provide user support contact information on key pages like Support and Feedback.
